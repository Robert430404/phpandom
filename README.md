### What is PHPandom?

This is a simple, random number based, raffle drawing script written for use by the Las Vegas PHP Meetup.

### How does it work?

You have two commands available to you with the script. You can set your raffle ticket number range, and you can draw a number.

Setting Range (Integers are expected and inforced in the script):

	php phpandom.php 1 100

Drawing A Number:

    php phpandom.php

Thats really all there is to say about it.
